<h1>The Best and Amazing Poem I have Ever Read</h1>
<h2>My top three poems of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. “The Raven” by Edgar Allen Poe (1845)</h3>
<p>
  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br /> Over many a
  quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br /> While I nodded, nearly napping,
  suddenly there came a tapping,<br /> As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
  chamber door.<br /> "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—<br />
  Only this and nothing more."
</p>
<h3>2. “Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare (1609)</h3>
<p>
  Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br /> Thou art more lovely and more
  temperate:<br /> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br /> And summer’s lease
  hath all too short a date:<br /> Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br /> And
  often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br /> And every fair from fair sometime
  declines,<br /> By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed:<br /> But thy eternal
  summer shall not fade,<br /> Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br /> Nor shall
  Death brag thou wander’st in his shade<br /> When in eternal lines to time thou
  grow’st:<br /> So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br /> So long lives this, and
  this gives life to thee.[1]
</p>
<h3>3. “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost (1916)</h3>
<p>
  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br /> And sorry I could not travel both<br /> And be
  one traveler, long I stood<br /> And looked down one as far as I could<br /> To where it
  bent in the undergrowth;<br /> Then took the other, as just as fair,<br /> And having
  perhaps the better claim,<br /> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br /> Though as for
  that the passing there<br /> Had worn them really about the same,<br /> And both that
  morning equally lay<br /> In leaves no step had trodden black.<br /> Oh, I kept the first
  for another day!<br /> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br /> I doubted if I should
  ever come back.<br /> I shall be telling this with a sigh<br /> Somewhere ages and ages
  hence:<br /> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br /> I took the one less traveled by,<br />
  And that has made all the difference.
